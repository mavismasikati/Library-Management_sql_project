CREATE TABLE book_issued_cnt AS
SELECT b.isbn, b.book_title, COUNT(ist.issued_id) AS issue_count
FROM issued_status as ist
JOIN books as b
ON ist.issued_book_isbn = b.isbn
GROUP BY 1,2;

FROM issued_status as ist
JOIN 
employees as e
ON e.emp_id = ist.issued_emp_id
JOIN
branch as b
ON e.branch_id = b.branch_id
LEFT JOIN
return_status as rs
ON rs.issued_id = ist.issued_id
JOIN 
books as bk
ON ist.issued_book_isbn = bk.isbn
GROUP BY 1, 2;

SELECT * FROM branch_reports;

---qn14CTAS: Create a Table of Active Members
